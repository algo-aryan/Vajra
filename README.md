# Vajra Sentinel

## Advanced Municipal Data Sovereignty & Forensic Defense System

Vajra Sentinel is a high-security ecosystem designed to protect
municipal data registries against advanced adversarial threats.

The system follows a strict **Defense-in-Depth** philosophy. It assumes
that perimeter defenses may fail and focuses on containment, deception,
and data integrity preservation.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## System Philosophy

Vajra Sentinel is built on three principles:

-   Assume breach
-   Minimize impact
-   Preserve verifiable truth

Instead of only blocking attackers, the system diverts, fragments,
audits, and neutralizes malicious activity.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Core Defensive Modules

## 1. Vajra Deception Engine

A controlled sandbox that absorbs and analyzes malicious traffic.

It redirects suspicious activity into mirrored environments.\
It prevents access to production systems.\
It logs forensic telemetry for investigation.

Key capabilities:

-   Recursive mirrored directory traps\
-   Shadow databases for SQL injection absorption\
-   Embedded forensic tokens\
-   Behavioral monitoring

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2. Steganographic Integrity Audit

A self-correcting integrity mechanism.

Each uploaded document receives a cryptographic hash.\
The hash is embedded into image pixels using LSB steganography.

The system continuously verifies database records against embedded
hashes.\
If tampering is detected, automatic rollback restores the original
truth.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3. Fragmented Storage Architecture

Sensitive documents are split into fragments.

Fragments are distributed across multiple nodes.\
A single compromised node cannot reconstruct full data.

Reassembly occurs only after authenticated validation.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 4. Botnet Hash Interdiction

Designed to counter high-frequency scraping and DDoS behavior.

Suspicious clients receive Proof-of-Work challenges.\
Legitimate users solve them instantly.\
Botnets are forced into heavy CPU exhaustion.

This converts attack traffic into self-inflicted resource drain.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 5. Secure Administrative Access

Administrative sessions require hybrid authorization.

Blake3 hashing ensures fast and secure validation.\
Hardware-triggered authorization prevents remote hijacking.\
CRYSTALS-Dilithium digital signatures provide post-quantum protection.

# System Architecture

  Stage            Process                   Purpose
  ---------------- ------------------------- --------------------------------
  Ingress          PoW Interdiction          Neutralize automated attacks
  Authentication   Hash + Physical Trigger   Prevent remote takeover
  Deception        Shadow Routing            Isolate malicious activity
  Processing       Steganographic Stamping   Embed cryptographic truth
  Storage          Fragmentation             Prevent total exfiltration
  Forensics        Authenticated Dossier     Preserve evidentiary integrity

# Threat Coverage

Vajra Sentinel mitigates:

-   SQL Injection\
-   Botnet Scraping\
-   Database Exfiltration\

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Design Summary

Vajra Sentinel does not rely solely on blocking threats.

It ensures attackers waste resources.\
It preserves truth at the pixel level.\
It fragments sensitive data.\
It generates verifiable forensic evidence.

The system remains resilient even under full database compromise.
